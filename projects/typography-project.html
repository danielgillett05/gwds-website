            <a href="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Axial.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Axial.jpg" alt="Axial Typography Poster"></a>
            <h2> Axial System</h2>
            <p>Axial designs arrange elements along an imaginary line or axis that divides the layout. The arrangement can be symmetrical or asymmetrical, providing structure and visual balance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gallery-item">
            <a href="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Bilateral.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Bilateral.jpg" alt="Bilateral Typography Poster"></a>
            <h2>Bilateral System</h2>
            <p>A bilateral system, places all elements symmetrically on either side of a central axis. This creates a formal and balanced design with a clear focal point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gallery-item">
            <a href="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Dilational.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Dilational.jpg" alt="Dilational Typography Poster"></a>
            <h2>Dilational System</h2>
            <p>A dilational system arranges elements in a circular pattern radiating outward from a central point. This creates a dynamic and engaging composition often used to convey movement or focus.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="gallery-item">
            <a href="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Grid.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Grid.jpg" alt="Grid Typography Poster"></a>
            <h2>Grid System</h2>
            <p>A grid system, divides the space into evenly spaced sections, creating a structured framework. Elements are placed within these sections for clarity and organisation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gallery-item">
            <a href="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Modular.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Modular.jpg" alt="Modular Typography Poster"></a>
            <h2>Modular System</h2>
            <p>The modular system is similiar to the grid system but uses sections of varying sizes and shapes, not following a specific pattern. This allows for more flexibilty and creative placement of elements within the design.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gallery-item">
            <a href="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Radial.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Radial.jpg" alt="Radial Typography Poster"></a>
            <h2>Radial System</h2>
            <p>A radial system arranges elements to extend outward from a central point of focus, creating a sense of movement and flow. This design approach emphasised the central point, drawing attention towards it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gallery-item">
            <a href="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Random.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Random.jpg" alt="Random Typography Poster"></a>
            <h2>Random System</h2>
            <p>In a random system, elements are placed without any specific pattern or order. This creates a spontaneous and dynamic design, often used to convey chaos or energy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gallery-item">
            <a href="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Transitional.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/projects/Typography Posters/Typography Transitional.jpg" alt="Transitional Typography Poster"></a>
            <h2>Transitional System</h2>
            <p>A transitional system arranges elements in layered, informal way, creating a sense of movement or progression. This design approach blends different sizes, shapes, and positions for a more fluid and dynamic composition.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

            <h2>Reflection on Typography Posters</h2>
            <p>Working on the typography posters was great as it helped me understand how different typography systems shape the look and feel of a poster. I learned how systems like axial, bilateral, and radial create different effects, from clear structure to dynamic movement. It really made me think about how small design choices can change how someone interacts with a layout. Whether it's the order of a grid or the randomness of a chaotic design, I liked how each system had a different vibe and purpose. This project helped me see how important it is to balance the creative side of a poster with clear communication.</p>
