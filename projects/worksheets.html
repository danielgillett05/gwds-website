                <p>As someone who is new to coding, I found week 1 very helpful because it got me familiar with the basics. I learned how to set up and publish a GitHub repository, find it in the Finder and on GitHub, and commit my work to save the progress. I also started using Visual Studio Code, which will be my main tool for coding.</p>

            <div class="worksheet">
                <img src="/assets/images/Week 2 coding sheet ss.png" alt="Week 2 coding worksheet">
                <p>I learned how to make a &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; for a HTML document. I looked at the structure of HTML focusing on block-level elements like &lt;h&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;ul&gt;, as well as inline elements like &lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, and &lt;small&gt;. I also learned how to add links using &lt;a&gt; tag and images using the &lt;img&gt; tag with src and alt attributes.</p>

            <div class="worksheet">
                <img src="/assets/images/Week 3 coding sheet ss.png" alt="Week 3 coding worksheet">
                <p>I looked at the basics of CSS and how to apply it to my HTML documents using the &lt;link&gt; tag. I also explored styling elements such as changing fonts, adjusting space using borders and padding and using flexbox for flexible layouts. Additionally, I learnt how to link multiple HTML files and CSS stylesheets to style different pages of a website.</p>

                <img src="/assets/images/Week 4 coding sheet ss.png" alt="Week 4 coding worksheet">
                <p>I focused on using Flexbox to create flexible, responsive layouts. I learned how to style and position menu items, including properties like flex-grow and flex-shrink. I also explored centering images on the page and embedding media, with Youtube videos and audio files. Furthermore, I learned how to pair media items with text and create anchor links.</p>

            <div class="worksheet">
                <img src="/assets/images/Week 5 coding sheet ss.png" alt="Week 5 coding worksheet">
                <p>I learned how to turn &lt;li&gt; elements into buttons and style them with CSS. I also added a footer and created a link button to navigate between pages. I duplicated my first page to create a second page and centered a large horizontal image, before looking at using custom fonts on both Google and Adobe Fonts. Unfortunately, the image didn't display, likely because there were no images in the folder for the worksheet I downloaded however I still understand what needs to be done going forward.</p>

            <h2>Reflection on Worksheets</h2>
            <p>Overall, the worksheets have been really helpful in giving me a basic understanding on how to code using HTML and CSS. I especially liked how I could jump straight into coding and apply what I was learning right away. Although I did find some aspects challenging, with issues that came up, I was able to find solutions by looking at resources provided and on the internet. Each week the tasks built on the last so it felt like I was constantly learning something new. I'm definitely more confident in my coding skills now, and I'm excited to keep building on this foundation.</p>
