                    <h2>Contrast Poster</h2>
                    <p>To create contrast I used the split between bold, warm orange and cool purple to form a striking visual divide. I chose heavy black text for "TRUE" and clean white text for "FALSE" to reinforce this contrast, making the words stand out while complimenting the divided colours. The faint texture of the face cut in half and placing the bottom half on top provide more contrast in the poster.</p>

                </a>
                <h2>Alignment Poster</h2>
                <p>I tried to keep this design clean, balanced and easy to follow making sure every element is lined up in the grid. I wanted the viewers eye to naturally flow from right to left using the larger text for the title. I  also used the rule of thirds to help situate where I put the text. This poster made me realise how small adjustments in alignment can make a big difference in how organised and impactful a clealry communicated design can be.</p>

                    <img src="/projects/4 CARP Posters/Repetition.jpg" alt="Repetition Poster">
                </a>
                <h2>Repetition Poster</h2>
                <p>I wanted to create a subtle yet impactful background implimenting the repetion of the words True/False. I thought this texture gave an interesting visual element without overwhelming the main content in the centre contrasting to the repeating pattern. This makes it easier to read and also adds depth to the design.</p>

                    <h2>Proximity Poster</h2>
                    <p>For this poster, I used proximity by placing the key words in the middle of a music disc to create a focal point. I feel that this made it stand out while also reflecting the theme of music and performance. The additional information is at the top and bottom to keep the design clean and minimal.</p>

            <h3>Reflection on CARP Posters</h3>
            <p>Making the CARP posters was a good learning experience as I haven't used inDesign before. It also challenged me to think about how different design elements can come together to communicate a clear message. I learned how small adjustments in layout and style can make a big impact on how a poster feels and how easily the information is understood.</p>
