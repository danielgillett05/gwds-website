        <h1>Reflection Essay</h1>
        <p>As part of the Graphic and Web Design Studio module, I had the opportunity to develop my skills in something I was most interested in compared to the other modules. The project involved creating a hand-coded website from scratch, showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and design principles like typography and layout. I found aspects of this module challenging as they were new to me, however, I feel that I did strengthen my technical skills and also deepened my understanding of design. 

        Starting out with the HTML and CSS worksheets was a great way to ease into the coding process. Initially, the idea of building a website from scratch seemed overwhelming, but the worksheets provided a structured path. I could immediately apply what I was learning, which helped me grasp the basics quickly. Each week's task built on the last, so I felt I was continuously progressing and expanding my  skills. Some parts were more challenging, especially when I encountered issues in my code, but I found the resources provided and online forums to be extremely helpful in troubleshooting. Over time, these problems became easier to solve, and I found that my confidence in coding grew. By the end of the project, I was much more comfortable with HTML and CSS, and I'm excited to continue building on this knowledge in future projects.

        One of the most interesting parts of the project was working on the CARP posters, as I have a background in  art. Before this module, I had never used Adobe InDesign, though I was familiar with other Adobe software. Learning InDesign was an important step in understanding how to manipulate design elements for effective communication. The CARP principles-Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, Proximity- were key in guiding my design decisions. I was surprised by how small adjustments in layout and style could dramatically change the message conveyed by the poster. The process challenged me to think about how design elements interact with one another and how subtle changes can affect clarity and impact. Creating posters that used these principles helped me refine my skills and taught me to approach design with more intention and awareness.

        The typography project was another big learning experience. Before this, I hadn't fully realised how much typography can influence a design. By experimenting with different typography systems I learned how typography shapes the tone and structure of a layout. I was amazed by how small decisions could significantly affect how a viewer interacts with the design. This project not only deepened my understanding of typography but also emphasised how essential it is to balance creativity with functionality to ensure that the design communicates its intended message clearly. 

        Building the website itself was an exciting and practical way to put everything I had learned into action from the coding worksheets. I also had the chance to incorporate the design principles from the CARP and typography projects into my site, creating a cohesive portfolio that showcased my work. Using GitHub and Visual Studio Code to write and publish my website was a new skill that I found very useful. This task gave me the confidence to continue developing my web design skills and also improve my knowledge by watching videos and tutorials on HTML and CSS coding in my spare time.

        Overall, the process of creating this website and completing the projects has been a rewarding learning experience. From the basics of HTML and CSS to the more creative aspects of typography and layout design, I feel that I've gained valuable skills that I can implement in future projects.
